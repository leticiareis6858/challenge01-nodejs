# Challenge 1 - PB Node.Js

This repository is for the first challenge of a node.js scholarship program of Compass. The challenge consists in the creation of a rest API for a veterinary franchise. With the requested patterns:

• GET /tutors -> Retrieves all tutors.

• POST /tutor -> Create a new tutor.

• PUT /tutor/:id -> Updates a tutor.

• DELETE /tutor/:id -> Deletes a tutor.

• POST /pet/:tutorId-> Creates a pet and adds it to a tutor.

• PUT /pet/:petId/tutor/:tutorId -> Updates a pet's info.

• DELETE /pet/:petId/tutor/:tutorId -> Deletes a pet from a tutor.

## 🚀 How it was made

This rest API was built using Node.js, Typescript, Express, mongoDB, VsCode, Postman, Eslint and Prettier.

Step to step of how to install it:

10. Rename the '.envExample' to '.env'

11. Use the 'VetClinic-API.postman_collection.json' file to import the Collection to your Postman workspace.

After that the API is ready to use.
